5. **Auto-Resolution** - Sends "resolved" notice when submissions resume

### Email Alert Format

Alerts include:
- Form name and ID

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

1. **Weekly**
   - Review alert logs
   - Check for false positives
   - Adjust thresholds if needed

2. **Monthly**
   - Clear old alert logs
   - Review form performance trends
   - Update alert rules for new forms

3. **Quarterly**
   - Audit email recipients
   - Test webhook integrations
   - Review and optimize thresholds

### Database Management

The plugin creates two tables:
- `wp_mycc_form_submissions` - Stores all submissions
- `wp_mycc_form_alerts` - Stores alert configurations

Data retention:
- Submissions: Kept indefinitely
- Alert logs: Last 100 entries in options table

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: All forms show as "Critical" or "Offline"
**Solution:** Submit test entries to initialize tracking. The plugin only tracks submissions that occur after activation.

### Issue: Too many alerts
**Solution:** Increase threshold times in Alert Rules. Consider time zones and business hours.

### Issue: Not receiving email alerts
**Solution:** 
1. Check WordPress email configuration
2. Verify SMTP settings if using external mail
3. Check spam folders
4. Test with "Test Alert" button

### Issue: WordPress cron not running
**Solution:** 
1. Install WP Crontrol plugin to verify
2. Add to wp-config.php: `define('DISABLE_WP_CRON', false);`
3. Set up real cron job if needed
